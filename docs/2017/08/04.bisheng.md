BiSheng
===

bisheng is designed to transform Markdown into static websites and blogs using React.

## CLI
We can install bisheng as a cli command and explore what it can do by `bisheng -h`. However, the recommended way to use bisheng is to install it as `devDependencies`.
```bash
$ npm install -g bisheng
$ bisheng -h
  Usage: bisheng [command] [options]

  Commands:

    start [options]     to start a server
    build [options]     to build and write static files to `config.output`
    gh-pages [options]  to deploy website to gh-pages
    help [cmd]          display help for [cmd]

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
```

## Configuration
bisheng will read `bisheng.config.js` as its config file, but we can set the config file name by `--config`, something like this bisheng `--config another.config.js`.

The content of `bisheng.config.js` looks like this:
```
module.exports = {
  port: 8000,
  source: './posts',
  output: './_site',
  theme: './_theme',
  htmlTemplate: path.join(__dirname, '../template.html'),
  doraConfig: {},
  webpackConfig(config) {
    return config;
  },

  entryName: 'index',
  root: '/',
};
```
